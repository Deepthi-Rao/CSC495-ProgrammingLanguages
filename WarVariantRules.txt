Variant on War:
2 players
Each player starts with 2 of each card 2 to A as a deck, face-down
Shuffle both decks
Both players draw a private hand of 3
Each plays 1 card, face-down, then flips simultaneously
Turn Win Condition: Higher card wins: 2 lowest up to 10, then face cards, then ace
Resolving ties:
	Each player places their hands (right now 2 cards) face-down
	Draws three cards face-down
	Selects one to play
	Remaining two become new hand
	Selected cards are flipped and compared by turn win condition
	Nested ties repeat this process
End-of-turn: all cards on field (not hand or deck or discard) go to discard
Each player draws cards from their deck to fill their hand to 3
Handling end-of-deck:
	When a player draws the last card of their deck, they shuffle their discard pile face-down and places it their new deck
	If a player does not have enough cards after this action:
		In the case of an active tiebreak, if the only cards are their previous hand, they select one to play as the comparison card.
		In any ongoing turn where the player has no more cards, their last card played to compare is used for all remaining comparisons that turn
			If both players are operating under this condition, then the game is a draw
Game Win Condition: Own all cards at the end of a turn
Draw Condition: Neither player can play a card, and neither can win the turn
